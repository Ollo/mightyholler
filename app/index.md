title: Mighty Holler
---


Born out of a love of making music together, Mighty Holler was formed! This group, or couple of couples, brings a connected energy to their performances. They enjoy bringing a variety of styles to their shows, including old time, bluegrass, new twists on classic songs, sweet harmonies, and original tunes.

**Brandy Ray** (vocals, songwriting, mandolin), **Elle Michelle** (vocals, songwriting, banjo), **Joshua Ray** (vocals, songwriting, guitar) and **Joe Gibb** (bass), bring multiple years of performance experience and musical sensibility to their shows and are a delight to enjoy.
